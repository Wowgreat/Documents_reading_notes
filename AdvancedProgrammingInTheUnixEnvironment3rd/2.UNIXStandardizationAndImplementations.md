- Compile-time limits(Headers) 
- Runtime limits not associated with a file or directory (the *sysconf* function)
- Runtime limits that are associated with a file or a directory(the *pathconf* and *fpathconf* function )

To further confuse things, if a particular runtime limit does not vary on a given system, it can be defined statically in a header.
